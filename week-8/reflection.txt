What content was solidified in the process of completing this challenge?

I was able to recall the different data types used in Ruby and the methods I found most useful for each.

What content do you feel a bit fuzzy on still?

I guess I still feel a little bit confused by some of the enumerable methods for hashes and arrays. I will review this subject in the book.

What was the most difficult part of this challenge?

The most difficult part of this challenge is finding the time and motivation to complete the work for this week, including this challenge, because I was sick all week.

Has your ability to add CSS to format and position objects improved since week 3?

Definitely! My website is pretty much how I want it so a lot of what I have to do now is simply pop material into the right place.
