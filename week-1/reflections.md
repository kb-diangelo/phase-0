# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Time: 1 hr

To think about time management in Phase 0, I used the provided resources to learn about ideas such as the Fogg Model of Behavior (which states that behavior is a result of motivation, ability, and a trigger at a certain moment in time. According to Fogg, habits can be built by associating "tiny habits" or very small changes with a specific trigger), time boxing (breaking longer tasks into intervals of a set amount of time, stopping when that time interval is reached, and evaluating one's progress. The Pomodoro technique of 25-minute time boxes is a specific example.) and about how mindfulness practice can decrease stress and increase productivity.

My current strategy for managing my time revolves around a daily to-do list. I think that this strategy might not be as effective in Phase 0 as at other points in my life, because (especially in the beginning) I will have very little sense of how long each exercise or challenge might take. I might be better served by planning to do a set number of time boxes daily, perhaps 5-10 boxes in the 30-60 minute range, depending on what seems to be working for me. Dedicating a certain amount of time daily to mindfulness/reflection & prayer is already a part of my life and one I intend to continue during my time in Phase 0.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

Time: 5 hrs

To understand what was happening in this assignment I had to do a little research on my own. I made a list of notes for myself defining the following terms:

* Shell - a user interface. The shell(s) we're trying to understand in this lesson use a command line interface.
* "bash" - the Unix shell that I'm using in this lesson
* Unix - an operating system
* Linux - a "Unix-like" operating system.
* Virtual Machine - the emulation of a particular operating system
* Ubuntu - a Linux operating system. My virtual machine runs Ubuntu.

As I understand it, when I open Git Bash, I am able to use a bash emulation to interact with Windows. I used this to complete the command line exercises in the Command Line Crash Course. I can also use Git Bash to open my virtual machine (using the command vagrant ssh) and within that virtual machine I am also using the bash shell. But because the folders and files I'm creating, moving and deleting from within that virtual machine are not accessible through Windows, it's a little harder for me to imagine how things are moving around. Trying to understand the relationship between Windows and my virtual machine was the most challenging part of this lesson. 

Using Git Bash, I was able to successfully use Unix commands while still in Windows. I was able to successfully use all of the commands and follow along with the lessons presented in the Crash Course. Within my virtual machine I was also successfully able to use the command though I had a harder time imagining how things were moving around. I think the most important command I learned was man. man allows you to view instructions and help for a given command. As I become more familiar with the command line I imagine I will be using man less and less but as a beginner it is invaluable. 

* pwd: prints the working directory
* ls; lists the directories and files inside the working directory
* mv: move a file from a directory to another, or renames a file
* cd: change directory
*../: I'm not sure what this does. I know typing cd .. moves you back "up" one directory
* touch: creates a new empty file, or resets an existing file's access time
* mkdir: makes a new empty directory
* less: displays a page's worth of a file's contents at a time
* rmdir: removes a directory
* rm: removes a file
* help: displays a list of shell commands
