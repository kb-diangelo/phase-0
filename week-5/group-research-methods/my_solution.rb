# .to_s : converts an object (in this case a fixnum) to a string
# .sort { |a, b| block comparing a and b with <=>} : uses the block provided to compare each item to its neighbor and return whether it comes before or after
# .sort_by { |a, b| a block telling it which to sort by} : uses the block provided to sort by what is specified
