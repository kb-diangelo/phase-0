<!-- 
* What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was satisfying to see my learning with HTML translate into an actual site, even if the site we were copying looked like it hadn't been changed since 1995. Even so, I was able to put into practice many of the tags I learned in the Codecademy course.

* How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I still have a bit of trouble understanding what consitutes a semantic HTML element. I know that the basic idea is that these are elements that have meaning, but which don't necessarily change the way the website looks. I still am confused about what <div> and <span> actually mean. But I understand <head> <header> <body>and <footer> and these are some elements that I used in this website.

* How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

My pair and I found it VERY difficult to resist the urge not to format the HTML and ended up using the <center> tag to center some text, even though that was probably wrong. 

* What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is very good for presenting information simply. I can imagine that technologies such as screen readers for the visually impaired can benefit from all the "invisible" semantic elements of HTML. But HTML is clearly not sufficient for the user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing websites I am used to on the modern Internet.

* What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

The main trick I use when writing HTML is that when I open a tag, I immediately make a corresponding closing tag if neccessary, and then filling out whatever code I need to between them. This way I never forget to close a tag.
