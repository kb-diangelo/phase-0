* What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is an image that that lets you plan the "skeleton" of a website. It breaks the website down into the major visual and semantic elements - header, body, footer, images, etc and gives you a framework from which you can begin to structure the site. 

* What are the benefits of wireframing?

A wireframe is like a skeleton or blueprint that you can work off of to build a website. It allows you to see where your information is going to go before you start coding, and gives you a basic structure that you can use to structure your code. It lets you see the basic layout of the website without being distracted by smaller details of the site design.

* Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I did not. I feel that I am fundamentally not a designer at heart. I have no sense of whether my design is intuitive or pleasing or any of that. I understand that it will be very difficult to write HTML (and CSS) without a wireframe to work off of but doing the exercise was stressful and intimidating. My wireframes were ultimately executed in that storied graphics program, Microsoft Paint, and look blocky and amateurish. I am not happy with them.

* Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I more or less stuck with my first idea. I tried to make it not just a copy of popular websites that I visit every day, but not so different from the basic structure that people are used to that it didn't make any intuitive sense.

* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

My first question of course was "What is a wireframe?" since I had no concept of the idea before this lesson. The provided article "A Beginner's Guide to Wireframing", by Winnie Lim was very helpful in introducing me to the concept and how to execute a basic wireframe. My continued questions of "Does this look good" and "Does this design make sense" are more subjective and a little harder to answer. I expect I'll be spending some time on design forums and soliciting feedback from real people when it comes to answering them.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

The whole challenge was not tedious, but stressful. Design is not intuitive for me in the slightest. I am not happy with the results of my work but I have no more time to spend on this project. Ultimately this is something I'm going to have to come back to, since I find myself struggling.
