1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

	The six phase of web design are information gathering (in which you think about factors such as your website's purpose, goals, target audience, and content in order to better determine what steps you're going to need to take to build it sucessfully), planning (in which you create a site map and decide what technologies should be implemented on your site), design (in which you look at the factors from your information gathering step in order to design a web page that is responsive to your needs, take into account aesthetics and usability, all to create a mockup of what your site will look like), development (in which the site itself is created), testing and delivery (in which the functionality of the site is confirmed and the site itself is uploaded to the server), and maintenance (in which a web site is maintained and updated - this phase goes on for the life of your web site).

2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

	My site's primary goal will be to introduce myself - tell people who I am and what I'm all about - and present myself in a good light for potential employers and collaborators. My site will feature content that displays my technical skills as well as some of my personal interests and passions.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

	My target audience - employers and collaborators - will be interested in my personal projects insofar as they will be looking for dynamic, interesting individuals for their teams, but will mostly be focusing on my technical knowhow and abilities. My site will have to feature a resume as well as projects that display my technical skills concretely.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

	I think the main "actions" the user should take on my site is to visit my technical portfolio and then, hopefully, contact me.

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

	The main thing that someone should know about design and user experience are, in my opinion
	- Design and UX are ultimately subjective
	- Design should be about addressing your site's unique characteristics and the problems they present (as per James Young's "Design is About Solving Problems" article for Smashing Magazine)
	- Design and UX should take into account accessiblity concerns, in order to reach the greatest number of users
	- Design and UX should also take into account performance across different platforms (as per Lara Hogan's "Designing for Performance" presentation on Speaker Deck)

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

	User experience (UX) design is design with an eye towards creating a pleasant experience for the user when interfacing with the website or product. The goals of UX design are to create an experience that the website/product is easy to use, feels valuable, is useful and efficient, and overall a good experience. 

	Websites/products with good UX design are more likely to be popular with users, and a user who visits a website they find pleasant and useful is more likely to come back. If the goals of your website include getting more visitors and having vistors come back, for example if you have a commerce website, or a website that is dependent on ad revenue, good UX is very valuable.

7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

	UX design is kind of an intuitive idea, but the article about it was very long and sounded like a sales pitch for me to hire a specialized UX designer. It was tedious to get through.
